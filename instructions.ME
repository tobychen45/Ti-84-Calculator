# TI-84 Calculator Simulation (Advanced) in C++

## Project Description
This project simulates a TI-84 calculator using C++, featuring basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), exponentiation, square root calculation, and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent). The program includes input validation and meaningful prompts for user-friendly interaction.

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Exponentiation (Power) and Square Root
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Input validation for numbers and square root
- Modular and expandable structure

## How to Compile and Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ ti84_calculator_advanced.cpp -o ti84_calculator_advanced
